# Follow Next Safari Extension

 Creates a keybinding allowing you to follow links that look like "next" or
 "previous" links.

## Installation

- Double click Safari extension bundle. Configure patterns (if desired) in preferences.

## Usage

- Press ^ ← *(ctrl-left)* for following 'previous' links
- Press ^ → *(ctrl-right)* for following 'next' links

Works for most sane page layouts, e.g.:

- Google search results
- Google issues, groups
- Most generic forums pagination
- Last fm comment boxes

Patterns can be tweaked in preferences to accommodate different cases.
